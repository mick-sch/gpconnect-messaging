The following test environments are available:

## Opentest (internet accessible using VPN) ##
The Opentest system is a platform based on Spine 2 Core, to which applications developers can connect their systems. Unlike the formal "path-to-live" environments there are very few pre-conditions (you do not even have to have a working system yet). Opentest is hosted off the NHS "N3/HSCN" network, so information governance prerequisites are not required before use.

More details on Opentest and request access can be found here - [https://digital.nhs.uk/services/spine/open-access-test-environment-for-spine-opentest](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/spine/open-access-test-environment-for-spine-opentest).

## Path-to-Live formal development and integration environments (accessible using N3/HSCN) ##
The formal path-to-live environments are hosted on N3/HSCN and as such the information governance prerequisites are required before use, as this is a predicate to connecting to N3/HSCN.

More details on the environments can be found here (N3/HSCN link required) - [http://www.assurancesupport.digital.nhs.uk](http://www.assurancesupport.digital.nhs.uk).
