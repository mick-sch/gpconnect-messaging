## User stories ##

The full set of business requirements that need to be met to support the sending of a Online Consultation Report to a patientâ€™s registered GP practice, or community pharmacy, after they have completed an online consultation, can be found on the [user stories page](senddocument_oc_userstories.html).

The requirements are described as a set of user stories with separate acceptance criteria for the sending and receiving systems, where applicable.


## Business process ##

The business process defines how the Online Consultation Report functionality will be used in a clinical context. It contains the following key components:

- process description
- process map
- process steps

Further detail about the business process can be found on the [process map page](sendmessage_oc_process.html).  

## Clinical engagement ##

To help ensure that the functionality being developed will be able to support GP practices, GP Connect has engaged with a range of GP practice staff to get an understanding of how that data may be used and what is required to support that use. 

This engagement has included:
- General Practitioners
- GP Nurses
- GP Pharmacists
- Practice Managers
- GP Practice Administration Staff

Community Pharmacists have also been engaged.

The feedback from these stakeholders has been used to develop the business process, user stories and PDF layout available above.
