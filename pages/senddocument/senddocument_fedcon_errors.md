The following section describes the error codes and scenarios utilised by Send Document.

## ITK errors ##

- where the received message does not conform to the requirements stated for [ITK3 header](senddocument_fedcon_itk3.html), or for the payload, the message **SHALL** be considered invalid
- where a received message is invalid, an ITK3 Response **SHALL** be generated, with the corresponding Negative ITK3 Response Code which indicates the nature of the error, and the message **SHALL NOT** be accepted for downstream processing

The table below indicates which ITK3 Negative Response should be used per error scenario:

| Error Scenario | ITK3 Negative Response Code |
| -------------- | -----------------------------|
| **ITK3 Header errors** |  |
| Mandated element not present (BusAck, InfAck, RecipientType, Priority, SenderReference, MessageDefinition, Timestamp, Event) |	10008 |
| InfAck element not set to true | 10002 |
| BusAck element not set to true | 10003 |
| RecipientType element not set to `FA` | 10010 |
| Priority element not set to `routine`	| 10006 |
| Event element not set to ITK007C | 10008 |
| **Payload business rules** |
| Payload content business rule violated | 10008 |

Where an ITK3 Response code is used, additional error context **SHALL** be provided in the `OperationOutcome.diagnostic` element to enable the sender to correctly identify the error which has been found in their sent message.

## Errors from MESH Endpoint Lookup ##

The following table describes error codes returned from the MESH server as a result of issues encountered using the facility to [route a message automatically to the registered practice](http://localhost:4006/integration_mesh.html#message-routing-to-registered-practice).

| MESH Error Code | Description |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| EPL-150 ERROR_TOO_MANY_MAILBOX_MATCHES | Multiple mailboxes matches |
| EPL-151 ERROR_NO_MAILBOX_MATCHES | No mailbox matched |
| EPL-152 ERROR_INVALID_NHSNUMBER | Invalid NHS Number |
| EPL-153 ERROR_NHSNUMBER_NOT_FOUND | NHS Number not found |
| EPL-154 ERROR_NO_DEMOGRAPHICS_MATCH |NHS Number supplied does not match the demographics |


MESH will generate these errors in the form of error reports which will be placed in the sender's mailbox to await collection and processing by the sending organisation. 

### MESH API errors ###

Please note that, when using the MESH API to send a message, errors encountered when using the automated registered practice routing will not be returned in the API response header or payload, but via a MESH error report .CTL file placed in the sending organisation MESH mailbox.

For example, where an invalid NHS Number has been supplied in the `Mex_To` HTTP header, an error report .CTL file will be returned with a `<StatusRecord>` section which provides error details as follows:

```xml
<StatusRecord>
    <DateTime>20170926135509</DateTime>
    <Event>SEND</Event>
    <Status>ERROR</Status>
    <StatusCode>EPL-152</StatusCode>
    <Description>Invalid NHS Number</Description>
  </StatusRecord>
```
