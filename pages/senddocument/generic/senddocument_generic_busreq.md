## User stories ##

The Generic payload has been designed to fill the current gap that is blocking a large number of organisations being able to sent documents back to a patient's registered GP practice.

If an organisation is already sending documents being received by the patient's registered GP practice then they automatically qualify for using the Generic payload.

Organisation's wanting to send something new back to the patient's registered GP practice will need to contact the GP Connect team to discuss their use-case in more detail to gain approval to proceed.



## Clinical engagement ##

To help ensure that the functionality being developed will be able to support GP practices, GP Connect has engaged with a range of GP practice staff to get an understanding of how that data may be used and what is required to support that use. 

This engagement has included:
- General Practitioners
- GP Nurses
- GP Pharmacists
- Practice Managers
- GP Practice Administration Staff

Community Pharmacists have also been engaged.

The feedback from these stakeholders has been used to develop the business process, user stories and PDF layout available above.
