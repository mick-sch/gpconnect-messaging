## User stories ##

The Generic payload has been designed to fill the current gap that is blocking a large number of organisations being able to sent documents back to a patient's registered GP practice.

If an organisation is already sending documents being received by the patient's registered GP practice then they automatically qualify for using the Generic payload.

Organisation's wanting to send something new back to the patient's registered GP practice will need to contact the GP Connect team to discuss their use-case in more detail to gain approval to proceed.
