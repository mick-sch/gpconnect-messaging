### User Stories and PDF Layout ###

The spreadsheet available for download below contains the full set of business requirements that need to be met to support the sending of a Consultation Report to a patientâ€™s registered GP practice after they have been seen by another GP practice in the same federation.

The requirements are described as a set of user stories with separate acceptance criteria for the provider and consumer systems. 

The PDF Layout defines the document layout and the data in that document.

### Clinical Engagement ###

To help ensure that the functionality being developed will be able to support GP practices, GP Connect has engaged with a range of GP practice staff to get an understanding of how that data may be used and what is required to support that use. 

This engagement has included:
- General Practitioners
- GP Nurses
- GP Pharmacists
- Practice Managers
- GP Practice Administration Staff

The feedback from these stakeholders has been used to develop the business process, user stories and PDF layout available above.
