summary: "Introduction to the GP Connect Messaging Send Document capability"
---

The Send Document capability provides a simple and standardised means of sending a document, such as a PDF, an image, or HTML file to a care provider system. Each message sent using the Send Document capability makes use of the GP Connect Messaging components, MESH, and ITK3 to deliver the message. 

All messages sent using this capability will be FHIR&reg; Messages, defined as a [FHIR composition](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/STU3/composition.html), constructed to meet the ITK3 standard and have a specific [payload](senddocument_fedcon_payload) structure.
