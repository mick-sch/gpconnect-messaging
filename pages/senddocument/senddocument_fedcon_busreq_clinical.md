## Engagement support ##

To help ensure that the functionality being developed will be able to support GP practices, GP Connect has engaged with a range of GP practice staff to get an understanding of how that data may be used and what is required to support that use. 

This engagement has included:
- General Practitioners
- GP Nurses
- GP Pharmacists
- Practice Managers
- GP Practice Administration Staff

The feedback from these stakeholders has been used to develop the [business process](sendmessage_process.html), [user stories](senddocument_userstories.html) and [PDF layout](senddocument_fedcon_busreq_pdf.html ) available above.
