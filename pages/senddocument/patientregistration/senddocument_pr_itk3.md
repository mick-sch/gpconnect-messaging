Please refer to [Using ITK3 to support GP Connect Messaging](integration_itk3.html) for an overview of the use of ITK3 in this context.

Requirements are given below which define how the [ITK3 Message Header](https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/ITK-MessageHeader-2) is populated in all instances of messages generated by sending organisations for this use case:

<table class="requirement-box">
  {% for item in site.data.pr_requirements.requirements %}
  {% if item.area == 'itk' %}
  <tr>
    <td id="{{item.id}}">{{item.id}}</td>
    <td>{{item.description}}</td>
  </tr>
  {% endif %}
  {% endfor %}
</table>

The following table indicates those elements which will not be present in the ITK3 Message Header:

<table class="requirement-box">
  {% for item in site.data.pr_requirements.requirements %}
  {% if item.area == 'itk1' %}
  <tr>
    <td id="{{item.id}}">{{item.id}}</td>
    <td>{{item.description}}</td>
  </tr>
  {% endif %}
  {% endfor %}
</table>
